# Train Controller for Arduino Uno
My own train simulator controller software for use with an Arduino Uno or Uno clones on Train Simulator classic AKA Railworks 3. Build your own cab for cheap.

What you need to get started:
- Arduino Uno or Uno clones (other arduinos might work if they have analog inputs too, but I can NOT guarantee that they will work)
- Arduino IDE (https://www.arduino.cc/en/software)
- Processing 4.0+ (version 4.0b8 used for developing: https://processing.org/download)
- Potentiometers & buttons (the amount of each depends on what kind of setup you will use)
- Wires
- Breadboard(s) for testing
- Some coding knowledge
- And lastly, some patience for setting this up. (Trust me, it is worth it if you enjoy train sim which you probably do considering you are here ðŸ˜†)

If you have questions or need help, please do not use the bugtracker for that. I will be setting up the wiki and a discord server if there is demand for it (For now you can use the bugtracker if you really need to, but classify it as a question please).

I am by no means the most professional or efficient coder, I know that! But any feedback or code suggestions on how to do things more efficiently is always welcome!

You can go to the wiki for a quick and simple how to (https://github.com/Subzero-Hiro/TrainController-Arduino-Uno/wiki)

I will be sharing more details in the future and hopefully I don't forget to update this readme.
